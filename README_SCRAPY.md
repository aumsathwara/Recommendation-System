- **macOS**: Download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- **Linux**: Follow [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

### 2. Python Dependencies

## üìÅ Output Files

- `output_mac_scrapy_splash.json` - Complete scraped data with images

## üîß How It Works

### 1. JavaScript Rendering with Splash
The scraper uses Splash to render JavaScript content, which allows it to:
- Load dynamically generated images
- Execute JavaScript code on the page
- Wait for content to load before scraping
- Handle lazy-loaded images

### 2. Individual Page Scraping
For each product found on the main page:
- Visits the individual product page
- Extracts detailed information including images
- Handles multiple image formats (JPG, PNG, WebP)
- Processes lazy-loaded images

### 3. Ethical Scraping Practices
- **Rate Limiting**: 3-second delays between requests
- **Robots.txt Compliance**: Respects website robots.txt
- **Proper Headers**: Uses realistic browser headers
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of failures
- **Limited Scope**: Scrapes only first 50 products for ethical reasons
